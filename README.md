## Problem solved && some Advices : 
 
- when i wanna upload the project on github, I find out that the projet size is very big. so i try this command to reduce the size from (~250Mo) to (~1.5Mo)

``find . -name "pubspec.yaml" -execdir flutter clean \;``

- when you got this error ***Windows git “warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF”***, try this ":

``git config --global core.autocrlf false``
